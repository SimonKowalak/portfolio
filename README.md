# About me

My name is Simon Kowalak. I graduated IT school with a specialization in internet applications, in Poznan, Poland (PCEUiP). Graduated also high school X with an IT profile in Poznan. Immediately after graduation, I started mastering my SEO knowledge, performing optimization tasks and design projects based on CMS Joomla! 1.5, 2.5, 3.0. My next step was deepening my knowledge of CMS Wordpress. I owned website related to consumer choices and their influence on the condition of the state economy. I have knowledge about online content creation, typography, and website usability. I am currently deepening my testing workshop. It is my pleasure to learn new IT tools, and practical solutions, especially in the field of web applications. I am deepening my test automation skills at work and after in free time. Main tool I use for automation tests is Selenium WebDriver + Java. I would like to share gained experience from personal studies and researches.

# My Project of Rest Assured + TestNG + ExtentReports Automation API Test Cases 

**[API tests cases verify is present SSL certificate, and is status code success for site 77bugs.pl](https://github.com/SimonKowalak/REST-API-Automation-tests-Rest-Assured-Project)**

# My examples of Page Object Model and Page Factory use + independent Selenium WebDriver

9 test caases for website with online store functionality 77bugs.pl | Design patterns use

**[Page Object Model | 9 test cases | Design pattern](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnd-Ksg4Ds1LIMbjStL-pYdjfBfsCeyW/view?usp=sharing)**

**[Page Object Model + Page Factory | 9 test cases](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CWxSZtLRk3z-14XWpRm6mtDsNOEltdYn/view?usp=sharing)**

**[Selenium WebDriver | 9 test cases | Hard to maintain and reuse code | No design pattern](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sXqpWb9TqkzCY_e0oN_1M5qoCoqXimkC/view?usp=sharing)**

Please notice that in this example is no Selenium WebDriver Framework use.

Code is easy to maintain, and reusable.
