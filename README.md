# About me

My name is Simon Kowalak. I graduated IT school with a specialization in web applications, in Poznań, Poland (PCEUiP) also high school X with an IT profile in Poznan. Immediately after graduation, I started mastering my SEO knowledge performing optimization tasks and design projects based on CMS Joomla! 1.5, 2.5, 3.0. For almost 2 years I have also been deepening my knowledge of CMS Wordpress. I run my own website related to consumer choices and their influence on the condition of the state economy. Have knowledge about online content creation, typography, and website usability. I am currently deepening my testing workshop. It is my pleasure to regularly learn new IT tools and practical solutions, especially in the field of web applications. Actually I practice automation tests with Selenium WebDriver + Java. I would like to share gained experience from personal studies and researches.

# My examples of Page Object Model and Page Factory use + independent Selenium WebDriver

9 test caases for website with online store functionality 77bugs.pl | Design patterns use

**[Page Object Model | 9 test cases | Design pattern](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FyNhgWO_-AdKjyGOl5s2EMHI-Bd-X2-O?usp=sharing)**

**[Page Object Model + Page Factory | 9 test cases](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gua6Dx_U0nsvESjykxlQlYLBEg4CYUlY?usp=sharing)**

**[Selenium WebDriver | 9 test cases | Hard to maintain and reuse code | No design pattern](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wTMtvvKLhdoxeqMIZsPej8-GNctI706c?usp=sharing)**

Please notice that in this example is no Selenium WebDriver Framework use.

Code is easy to maintain, and reusable.
