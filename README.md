Immediately after graduation, I started mastering my SEO knowledge by desing and performing optimization tasks for projects and CMS Joomla! 1.5, 2.5, 3.0. For almost 2 years I have also been deepening my knowledge of CMS Wordpress. In my spare time I run my own website related to consumer choices and their influence on the condition of the state economy. I am currently deepening my testing workshop. It is my pleasure to regularly learn new IT tools and practical solutions, especially in the field of web applications. Actually I learn how to perform REST API testing with Postman. I would like to share gained experience from personal studies and researches.
