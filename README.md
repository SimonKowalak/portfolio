# About me

My name is Simon Kowalak. I graduated IT school with a specialization in web applications, in Poznań, Poland (PCEUiP) also high school X with an IT profile in Poznan. Immediately after graduation, I started mastering my SEO knowledge performing optimization tasks and design projects based on CMS Joomla! 1.5, 2.5, 3.0. For almost 2 years I have also been deepening my knowledge of CMS Wordpress. I run my own website related to consumer choices and their influence on the condition of the state economy. Have knowledge about online content creation, typography, and website usability. I am currently deepening my testing workshop. It is my pleasure to regularly learn new IT tools and practical solutions, especially in the field of web applications. Actually I practice automation tests with Selenium WebDriver + Java + JUnit. I would like to share gained experience from personal studies and researches.

# My examples of use Page Object Model and Page Factory + simple Selenium without design pattern 

9 test caases for website with online store functionality 77bugs.pl | Design patterns use

**[Page Object Model | 9 test cases | Design pattern](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A6z2esIytVnlU7jBC43NouP2NbEGFsCD?usp=sharing)**

**[Page Factory | 9 test cases | Design pattern](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWLABSl1MJVdDU3x8HfqJeO8iFUCEPUS?usp=sharing)**

**[Selenium WebDriver | 9 test cases | Hard to maintain and reuse code | No design pattern](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1smt73DTZ11G14RDd7r7THRbHL52cwLVJ?usp=sharing)**
