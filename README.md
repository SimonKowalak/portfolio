# About me

My name is Simon Kowalak. I graduated IT school with a specialization in web applications, in Poznań, Poland (PCEUiP) also high school X with an IT profile in Poznan. Immediately after graduation, I started mastering my SEO knowledge performing optimization tasks and design projects based on CMS Joomla! 1.5, 2.5, 3.0. For almost 2 years I have also been deepening my knowledge of CMS Wordpress. I run my own website related to consumer choices and their influence on the condition of the state economy. Have knowledge about online content creation, typography, and website usability. I am currently deepening my testing workshop. It is my pleasure to regularly learn new IT tools and practical solutions, especially in the field of web applications. Actually I learn how to perform REST API testing with Postman. I would like to share gained experience from personal studies and researches.
