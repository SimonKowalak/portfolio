# About me

My name is Simon Kowalak. I graduated IT school with a specialization in web applications, in Poznan, Poland (PCEUiP). Graduated also high school X with an IT profile in Poznan. Immediately after graduation, I started mastering my SEO knowledge performing optimization tasks and design projects based on CMS Joomla! 1.5, 2.5, 3.0. My next step was deepening my knowledge of CMS Wordpress. I owned website related to consumer choices and their influence on the condition of the state economy. I have knowledge about online content creation, typography, and website usability. I am currently deepening my testing workshop. It is my pleasure to learn new IT tools, and practical solutions, especially in the field of web applications. I am deepening my test automation skills at work and after in free time. I practice automation tests with Selenium WebDriver + Java. I would like to share gained experience from personal studies and researches.
